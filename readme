 --- The ffmpeg_remote_player ---
 
 How to use it:
 1) add your valid path to local builds of ffmpeg and opencv to CMakeList.txt
 2) or include this libraries by some other way
 3) run ./build.sh
 4) if it will be done then you can test it by run ./test.sh
 5) use ./clean.sh for remove the builds
 
 P.S.: client/server works now with opencv encoding
